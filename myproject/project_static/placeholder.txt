This folder is where you should put site-wide static assets.  For example,
if you were building a site based on Bootstrap and jQuery, you would put the
CSS and JS files in here, so that they are available to all the apps in your
project.

Note that this file is called placeholder.txt, so that it does not collide
with static_root/placeholder.md when we run collectstatic.
